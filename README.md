Simple ballistic calculator for the minecraft mod Create: Big Cannons

## How to use
1. Download the .exe file or build it yourself

2. Run the project

3. Input your cannon's position and the target position when asked

4. You will be shown the yaw angle as well as several possible pitch angles (depending on how many charges to use)

## Note
Your cannon's accuracy is affected by how many barrels it has

The calculator does not account for drag from water or other fluids.

Not perfectly accurate because it uses a stupid way of checking for hits. But it gets very close. (all hits within 5 blocks)
